Cookiecutter NAO Python App
======================

This is a template for application simple application for NAO using Python 3 for NAO (which is in private beta).

It uses [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to generate it; in command line:

> pip install cookiecutter
> cookiecutter http://github.com/EmileKroeger/cookiecutter_naoapp

You will then be asked your name, email and project name.

This will then generate a project folder you can use with NAO. See that project's README for more details.

This is based on [https://github.com/aldebaran/robot-jumpstarter] (a set of project templates for NAO/Pepper), and adapted to Python 3 and cookiecutter.
